# Database Management System of Health Insurance

## Relational database
Manage the insertion, storage and efficient retrieval of the data of the insurance company. 

## Steps
1. Gathered the domain knowledge of working of the insurance company and the challenges faced by them. 
2. Implement part of the problem by listing the required information and assumed a health insurance product as a business case for this project.
3. Made an **Enhanced Entity Relation Diagram** of the insurance product and made a **Class diagram** using the gathered information. 
4. Used both of the diagrams to construct a **relational model** before implementing it in MySQL. 
5. Randomly created our own dataset which resembled the real world scenario. 
6. Using the **MySQL Workbench** we created several tables and imported the dataset into MySQL.
7. Developed various real world situations relevant to our business case and retrieved the answers to them using SQL queries.
- Managed our part of the database in the **NoSQL (MongoDB)** environment and used **MapReduce** and **aggregate** functions. 
8. Access edour database using **R** and made analysis of the retrieved data.
